* Problem
+ Different communication technologies sharing the same spectrum.
+ Jamming attacks are especially harmful to wireless communication.
+ Packet collisions force repeated backoff of  legitimate users.
+ The locations of jammers allow a better physical arrangement of wireless devices.
+ This paper uses a node's neighbor list changes caused by jamming attacks to localize a jammer.
* Network Model and Jamming Model
**  Network Modle
+ Multihop
+ Stationary
+ Neighbor aware
+ Location aware
+ Homogeneous
+ Adaptive-CCA
** Jamming Modle
- Constant jammer :: We use a constant jammer that continually emits a radio signal.
- Omnidirectional :: Every jammer has the same jamming range in all directions.
- Nonoverlapping :: We assume there are one or more jammers in the network, but none of their jamming regions overlap.
** Communication Range
- The hearing range :: The hearing range of A specifies the area within which the potential transmitters can deliver their message to A .
- The sending range :: The sending range of A defines the region within which the potential receivers can receive the messages of A .
* Communication in Nonjamming Scenarios
** Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR)
The threshold required to decode a signal successfully.
\begin{equation}
 (SNR)_{B \to A} < \gamma_0 
\end{equation}
** Free-Space Propagation Model
Consider the standard free-space propagation model, the received power is:
\begin{equation}
 P_R = \frac{P_{T}G}{4{\pi}d^2}.
\end{equation}
* The Effect of Jamming on Network Topology
** Classification Schema
- Unaffected node :: A node can receive packets from all of its neighbors .
- Jammed node :: A node cannot receive messages from any of the unaffected nodes . 
- Boundary node :: A boundary node can receive packets from part of its neighbors but not from all its neighbors .

* LSQ-BASED Jammer Localization
** Algorithm Description
*** Simple Example 
 Consider the example illustrated in this figure:
 [[./1125/se1.png]]
*** Scenario Analysis
 If B happens to be located at the edge of the hearing range of A, then we have:
\begin{equation}
 (SNR)_{B \to A} \approx \gamma_0 ,
 d_{AB} = r_{h_A} ,
 (SNR)_{B \to A} \approx \frac{{P_T}/{d^{2}_{AB}}}{{P_J}/{d^{2}_{JA}}} .
\end{equation}
 Therefore, we can obtain the following formula:
\begin{equation}
 (x_A - x_J)^2 + (y_A - y_J)^2 = {\beta}r^{2}_{h_A} .
\end{equation}
*** Localization Formula
\begin{equation}
 (x_1 - x_J)^2 + (y_1 - y_J)^2 = {\beta}r^{2}_{h_1}  \\
 (x_2 - x_J)^2 + (y_2 - y_J)^2 = {\beta}r^{2}_{h_2}   \\
                     \vdots                                              \\
  (x_m - x_J)^2 + (y_m - y_J)^2 = {\beta}r^{2}_{h_m}     \\
    \textbf{z} = [x_J,y_J,\beta]^T  
\end{equation}
** Estimating the Hearing Radius
*** Two Specially Located Nodes
- Lower bound :: The furthest neighbor that Node A can still hear from.
- Upper bound :: The closest node that Node A cannot hear from.
*** The Hearing Radius
The hearing radius of A can be estimated as the mean value of these two kind of bounds.

* Localizing a Jammer in Reality
** Log-Normal Shadowing Model
The log-normal shadowing model captures both path loss versus distance along with the random attenuation due to blockage from objects. 
\begin{equation}
 PL(d) = PL(d_0) - 10 \cdot \eta \cdot \log(\frac{d}{d_0}) + X_{\sigma}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 P_R = \frac{P_{T}G}{4{\pi}d^2}
\end{equation}
** Dealing with Signal Irregularity
*** Centroid-Based Localization (CL)
Consider that there are m boundary nodes, the position of the jammer can be estimated by:
\begin{equation}
\hat{J} = (\hat{x}_J , \hat{y}_J) = ( \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{m}x_k}{m} ,  \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{m}y}{m} ) .
\end{equation}
*** Adaptive LSQ Localization
 Combines the CL method with the LSQ algorithm.

* Experiment Validation
** Impact of the node density
As N increases, the performance of the adaptive LSQ-based algorithm improves for all .
[[./1125/nd.png]]
** Impact of the jammer's NLB range
As the jammer's NLB range increases, the accuracy of the estimated jammer's location does not change much.
[[./1125/nr.png]]
** Impact of the jammer's position
When the jammer is located at the corner, the mean estimation errors become around 30 m.
